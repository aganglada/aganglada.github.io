           <p>
              Born in Malaga (Spain), I am a 25 years old dreamer that goes where situations take me.
              I love my job and what I do everyday.
           </p>
           <p>
               My motivation is to impact the users and to make them feel what I do when I code.
               I really love learning things by my own and I beleive I am a really good team player.
           </p>
            <p>
                I like sharing knowledge, in fact I’m the MallorcaJS organizer and I am keen and open minded
                to try new technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am Frontend evangelist with 5 years of experience working on production ready, complex and
                performance Angular applications. Also, I have worked already 2 years on a side React, Flux and
                NodeJS project, willing to find the best price for a rent apartment in your city into different websites.
                But this is not everything I can offer. I’m vanillaJS enthusiast, CSS styler and semantics obsessed.
                I have passion for coding, and I’m not scare of making mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I join trivago I have got some experience working with Symfony2 (PHP) and Java/Android.
                In my spare time I like not only to think on new ideas, but to develop products that could solve other’s people problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                My professional goal has always been not to leave anything behind in the sense of continuing to learn
                every day mistakes and successes.
